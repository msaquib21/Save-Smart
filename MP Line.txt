Module Pack LINE 40 GWh (3x13.3 GWh)

The scope of this document is to capture the line functionality for the 3 x 40 PPM Module Pack line for
meeting the capacity of 40 GWh. It includes the overall layout concept, production process flow, details
of automation, material flow, manpower, utilities & fire safety requirements of three separate lines
each having capacity of 13.3 GWh.

Scope and Layout (Pages 1–5): Defines the project’s purpose, covering functionality, automation, material flow, manpower, utilities, and safety.
The facility layout includes three 142m x 43m Module Pack Lines, with a focus on integrated operations.

Product and Process (Pages 6–16): Details product variants, automated line concepts (AGV-based material movement), and process steps 
(Module Line: OP10–OP170; Pack Line: ST10–ST160). The line supports flexible production of 2P7S and 1P13S modules, with 18 operators per line (54 total).
Cycle times are optimized for 40 PPM, though some processes (e.g., leak testing) exceed design targets.

Material and Logistics (Pages 8, 14): Lists module-level BOM and raw material feeding rates, with high AGV traffic (e.g., 84/shift for cells). Fixture replacements are needed for dimensional changes.
Utilities and Environment (Pages 40–49): Specifies water (11,000 liters/day), compressed air (3000 CFM), nitrogen (80 Nm³/h), and environmental conditions (5–28°C, ≤80% RH for production; tighter for IT areas). Manual air supply is noted for some stations.
Safety and Waste (Pages 50–59): Addresses risks (thermal runaway, fire) with standards (UL 1973, IEC 62619, NFPA 1) and compliance with National Building Code 2016. Waste generation (1% rejection rate) requires 418 m² for 30 days, with disposal via Gujarat State Pollution Control Board-approved vendors.
Automation and Flexibility (Pages 6, 12–13): Emphasizes automation (most processes are auto), with manual tasks like busbar installation and inspections. Jamnagar’s line is more flexible than Hithium USA’s, supporting both module variants.
